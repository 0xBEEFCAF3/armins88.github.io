            Leaching of lead and other contaminants into tap water poses a
            significant health risk and is expensive to accurately and
            efficiently detect in real time. We have utilized commer- cially
            available low-cost water metric sensors to represent water samples
            in an n-dimensional space and leveraged classification models to
            detect lead contamination in tap water. Experimental results suggest
            that our novel methodology is an effective and cost efficient way to
            detect lead contamination. Furthermore, our data driven approach
            shows promise of being applied to other heavy metal contaminants and
            organic pollutants while still using the same hardware.
